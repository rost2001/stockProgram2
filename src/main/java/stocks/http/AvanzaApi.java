	/* Todo idea or thoughts:
	 * ---------------------
	 * :Mess around with Httpclient or other library to Make a way to log into avanza in the program using tvåfaktors inloggning(TOTP)
	 * :Go through GET and POST requests on avanza in chrome by using the F12 networking view in chrome 
	 * 			and it gets easier by checking the "doc" checkbox to get rid of spam and ads
	 * 
	 * :Implement the GET and POST of the steps/choices one can take on avanza to traverse the website, make/remove/view orders and gathering an account overview
	 * :Design the Api with cool and useful methods, or any method of choice
